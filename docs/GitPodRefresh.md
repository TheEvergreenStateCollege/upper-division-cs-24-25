# GitPod Refresh

GitPod is a cloud development environment that lets the
upper division class use a reproducible build environment
that's accessible via the web.

Every quarter, teaching staff can follow these steps.

## How To Steps

1. In an old / existing Gitpod workspace:
   a. Remove unneeded packages and add needed packages to `.gitpod.Dockerfile`
   b. 
2. `gp validate` 
3. Start a new workspace to build the image and cache it for the next person.
