## Correspondences Between Two Views

Last time, we began code in OpenCV to detect points in real space $ \mathbb{R}^3 $ labeled with sharpie
text and using OCR so that we could auto-label projected points in images $ \mathbb{P}^2 $.

Our goal is to build a calibration corner, a 1-foot-cubed checkboard pattern wooden corner,
that we can rotate and translate with a posable camera to a known projection matrix,
and then recover these camera parameters using the matrix math of MVG.
