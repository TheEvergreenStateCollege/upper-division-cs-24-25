Extracting camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters

https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs231a/course_notes/01-camera-models.pdf

Problem:

Write out the following $4x4$ matrices:

* a 30 degree angle rotation ($\pi / 6$ radians) about the x-axis,
in a homogenous 4-coordinate system

* a 60 degree angle rotation ($\pi / 3$ radians) about the y-axis

* a 45 degree angle rotation ($\pi / 4$ radians) about the x-axis

* a translation of (1,2,1) along $(x,y,z)$ axes

Write out a $4x3$ matrix that projects the real point $(0,0,0)$ onto
a camera's image plane that is located at $(0,2,1)$ 

Euler angle rotation matrices

These matrices, and the translation one, can be used to describe how to transform
coordinates in reality (Euclidean or $\mathbb{R}^3$ space.

appear to be useful in
describing the path that a camera takes from one projection of an image plane to another.
