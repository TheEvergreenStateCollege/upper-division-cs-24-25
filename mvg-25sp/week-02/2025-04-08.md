Update:

Hexapod robot is getting shipped, will arrive around the 12th.

Part I

Download and install OpenCV to detect labeled text in images for a calibration rig.

We will detect labeled text to find projected points `p_i` in 2D images, and then
use numpy's SVD routine to compute the camera's projection matrix.

We can use the ocrmac package on Mac to extract text from PIL images.

Part II

Create a parts list for an IR photoemitter + sensor to detect.
