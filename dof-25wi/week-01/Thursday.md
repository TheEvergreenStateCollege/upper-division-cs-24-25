# Systems of Data and the Organic Farm - Week 01
Thursday

Facilitated by Paul

## Agenda

Hang up butcher paper 

1:00pm Check-in, group feedback, feedback on feedback 
1:15pm First Activity
  * Electrical concepts: voltage / potential, amperes / currents, ohms / resistance, watts / power
    * equations to relate them, Ohm's Law
  * Electrical wiring 101, different wire gauge sizes
  * Electrical safety, grounding, static discharge, live wires, turning off power
  * Fire safety
  * Transistor and diode basics
    * voltage / current transfer curves
    * transistors: as gates everywhere in digital electronics (FETs)
    * diodes: light-emitting, polarity-protection on power lines-
  * Blinking LED from GPIO of Raspberry Pi
    * Protoboards, and rows connected
    * Measuring with multimeter
    * Measuring with an oscilloscope (if one is available)  
1:55pm Break
2:05pm Discuss volunteers to facilitate future class meetings
  * Edit the markdown file for your given week
  * Collect agenda items from yourself and classmates.
  * What is important to talk about and get feedback from everyone?
  * How long is an appropriate amount of time to talk about it?
  * Come to potluck Mondays to get help preparing for your activity, finding needed equipment
2:15pm List all possible class activities to teach us needed skills 
  * Don't worry if we don't know who is going to lead the activity yet, we can find them
    * A future activity: finding guest speakers, visiting different centers on campus 
  * Paul will lead first activity Thursday of Week 01: electrical safety, protoboards, look for multimeters and oscilloscopes
  * Melissa will lead second activity Tuesday of Week 02: desired data tables for farm, feedback on our data proposals from DSA-24au
  * Activities can include both learning to do farming activities and computer / electronics engineering work
2:55pm End with gratitude, clean up PCC

## Homework - Week 01

* Writing / Designing Homework: Your first draft of an ILC contract will be due next Tuesday
* Building / Maintaining Homework: Agree with your teammates what you want to prototype, test, build, or maintain this week
