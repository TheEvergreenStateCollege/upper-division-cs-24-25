Potluck at the Organic Farmhouse

## Who Will Bring What

Paul: beef stew (if someone reads this in time, can you bring a vegan option?)
Melissa: bread and butter
Ocean: olive oil
(Add your name and what you'd like to bring, or just show up! All contributions appreciated).

Warning: stew may be served out of paper cups.

Drinks and other snacks welcome.

Other farm students and faculty may join us!

In the rare case that Advanced Computing has a zoom meeting at this time,
students who are taking both programs may move to the SAL across the road with laptops to join the Zoom call.

## Preparation

Read this Canvas assignment and watch the recommended video.

Start thinking of API calls (which could be JSON messages) that are examples of what our devices will
call in real operation.

## Feedback from Wash Station Mock-Through Activity

After Monday's potluck and activity, write your feedback here as Markdown.
(Click the "edit" blue button in the top-left on GitHub's website).

Answer some or all of these questions:
* Was this a realistic activity? Why or why not?
* What would you change about it to make it more effective and realistic?
* Who should we, or would you like to invite, on campus for our next mock-through on a future Monday?
* What piece should we automate first, so that our next activity one role can be replaced with a Raspberry Pi?

You can sign your name or not.
