Hello Mellissa,
 We would like to invite you to our Edible Campus program garden design charrettes. Our program hopes to design new campus community gardens and food forests in the vein of our program mission. Our mission is creating socially inviting, sustainable foodscapes across The Evergreen State College campuses that inspire food sovereignty, nurture community engagement, and promote well-being through experiential education. The purpose of this design charrette is to introduce stakeholders to our initial design concepts and gain your feedback and opinions to incorporate into our ongoing project work. We will also be hosting another design charrette Thursday of week eight to share design refinements from your input and seek further feedback from you and other stakeholders. Please consider attending both of the charrettes as your schedule allows. 
 
The charrettes will be hosted as open houses to allow people to attend as they are able during the event hours. Student ambassadors will orient you to stations for each of three design locations, answer questions about the design materials, listen to your comments, and ask you to fill out a brief feedback form.
 
First charrette event: Thursday, Feb 13, from 2-4 pm in SEM II B1107 
 
Second charrette event: Thursday, Feb 27, from 2-4 pm in SEM II B1107 
 
Please RSVP if you plan on attending and let me know if you have any questions. 
On behalf of Edible Campus,
Solomon
