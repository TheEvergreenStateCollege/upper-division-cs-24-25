## Learning Outcomes

All students will learn:
* To design and document an engineering system with sufficient detail for a later cohort of students to build, extend, and maintain the system, and update the documentation.
* To learn how to enjoy working safely in an engineering team
* To participate in a [future search]() and holistic system design process
* To propose a Student-Originated Studies (SOS) to future faculty

Students may choose to focus on additional learning outcomes as desired
* To wire and test Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems
  * including automated systems for collecting data from produce weighings and worker hours
* To program and work with single-board computers (SBCs)
* To design and work with streaming data architectures and message queues (MQTT or Apache Kafka)
* To build and maintain solar powered computation
  * possibly including a solarprotocol.net node
* To host an e-commerce website for online sales of the Organic Farm's produce
* To connect with College resources including Science Instructional Technicians, the Science Support Center.
* To advocate for an electronics engineering teacher at Evergreen
