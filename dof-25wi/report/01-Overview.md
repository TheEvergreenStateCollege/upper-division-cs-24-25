This report summarizes the work of our Student-Originated Studies (SOS) during the Winter 2025 quarter at The Evergreen State College studying how we could automate data collection on our organic farm. Our SOS has a number of unique features as far as our team is aware:
* it describes college assets (durable equipment, materials) meant to last multiple quarters and be used in future SOS's, and programs in both computer science (such as Data Structures & Algorithms) and agricultural science (Principles of Farming).
* it involves students in the curricular development and budgeting process.

The report documents work that has already been done, is in progress, or designs and plans for future work. It's the task of each section to describe the distinction between these stages.

We are excited about this work. If you are moved by these writings, please reach out to any of our team members.

## Project Proposal and Bill of Materials

Our work builds on the student design proposal begun in Data Structures & Algorithms and Computer Club in Winter 2024.

[Farm + Data Project Proposal](https://github.com/absentbird/TESC-Farm/blob/main/documents/farm-project.pdf)

The project proposal begins with the project idea as laid out by faculty and was developed mainly by students to reflect their interests and understanding. It describes the motivation for the project, gives context on how it relates to multiple areas of the college, and starts the co-design process of the system by describing its components, proposing how they are to be connected, and requesting specific equipment and materials from the College.

Starting with this proposal, our SOS work on a process during Winter quarter, engaging with discussion between the Academic Budgeting Office and Provost, the Information Technology department at the College, Building Supervisors, Science Instructional Technicians, the Science Support Center, and faculty to make progress on two goals:
* move towards having equipment to be installated and assembled to prototype the digital wash station when its own construction is finished at the Organic Farm
* plan, document, and enact a maintenance plan including IT and network security best practices, and onboarding new student members interested in contributing to the project
