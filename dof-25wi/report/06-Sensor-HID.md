# Section 06: Sensors as Human Interface Devices

[Back to Table Contents](SOS-Farm-Data-Report-25wi)

In this section, we describe the architecture of using. ESP32 or Arduino boards to write data to the Raspberry Pi server, communicating with it as Human Interface Devices (HIDs), using the HID protocol the way mice and keyboards communicate with operating systems. 

This is a higher "application-level" hardware protocol, that can be carried over a lower "physical-level" hardware protocol like Bluetooth (for wireless connectivity over the range of the wash station) or USB cables (for wired connectivity, over obtainable and feasible lengths of USB cables in the wash station) between each sensor location and the Raspberry Pi.
