### Farming and Business
[The Organic Farmer's Business Handbook](https://www.richardwiswall.com/the-organic-farmer-s-business-handb) by Richard Riswall

### Electronics and Robotics

[Practical Electronics for Inventors, by Paul Scherz and Simon Monk](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26271792)

[Aquaponics Greenhouse at Open Source Ecology]()

### Programming, Golang Tutorial, REST APIs

Paul is evaluating 
[Joe Calhoun's playlist for learning Go for Web and API development from scratch](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVEltXlEeWgkKucovAMCih4T0hQITxRX3)

This appears suitable for farm students who want to learn some programming, and understand some of the technical
details for running the [Golang API from absentbird's repo]().

If you have more time to learn web programming from the beginning, consider
these courses from Evergreen's PaCE Web Design certificate program that are offered every year.

A more advanced, non-video tutorial. Paul is evaluating this for people who already know how to program,
especially writing an API in another language besides Go. This is definitely not for beginners but may
be suitable for existing computer science students.

### Drones

Skydio 2+: One possible affordable American-made drone for agriculatural tracking, photogrammetry.

For reference, "affordable" means about $1700
