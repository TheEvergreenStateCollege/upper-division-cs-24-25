Implement a prefix tree that can be used to solve the longest-repeating substring problem (LRS) in $O(n^2)$ time and space.

You may adapt the Java implementation from Week 05, or write your own from scratch.

Provide a sketch or argument in English why your solution is $O(n^2)$ , especially if you believe yours is $o(n^2)$ , such as linear time or $O(n \log n)$.

Commit and push your solution into GitHub.
