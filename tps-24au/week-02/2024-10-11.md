# Technical Problem-Solving Class Notes
Week 02, Friday Afternoon, 2024-10-11

## First Hour

Warmup:
* Bit problems
	* find highest 1 bit
	* can use `>>>` unsigned right shift operator in Java

Number Complements Problem
https://leetcode.com/problems/number-complement/description/

If you complete this problem with Java's built-in `Integer.highestOneBit()` method, try implementing your own highest one bit from scratch.

Roman Numerals Problem
https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/description/

If you complete this problem with $O(nd)$ time and $O(d)$ space, where `n` is the number of input Roman numeral digits and `d` is the number of different kinds of Roman digits, try optimizing your solution to use $O(n)$ time only, still with $O(d)$ space allowed.

Design Critique of Each Other's Code
* Not just criticising / finding fault
* Describing in English in a few sentences
* Writing pseudocode algorithm
* Try to identify the approach and goal of the writer and see if you can improve or complete the development in that direction


## Break
## Second Hour

Common Features of Longest Substring Problems
* Building a candidate
* Do we need to backtrack?
	* If we are currently building a candidate, do we need to keep of any previous best candidate?
* Apply to a new problem:
	* Longest repeating substring
	* "abcabcdbb" => "abc"
	* "abababab" => "ab"

Coming up with Test Cases
* Simple edge cases (one that can be generated in constant time, e.g. empty lists, empty strings)
* Scaling up solutions to max out time
