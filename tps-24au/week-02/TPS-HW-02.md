Solve the following leetcode problems, both using the suggested data structures and without.
Are they an improvement?

Consider the following criteria:
* Does is make your code shorter or easier to understand?
* Is it asymptotically more efficient? (For example, does it change a O(n^2) algorithm to a O(n) algorithm)

Solve as many of the following problems as you can in 6 hours of working outside of class.
Do not search for or use others solutions posted on the internet, especially forums, github, Youtube, stackoverflow, or AI chat.

## Java Review


## Number Complements
(Acceptance Percentage 70.3%)

Flip all the bits of a number to get its complement, with the same bit width as the leading 1.

The decimal number 5 (in binary 101) -> has a complement of 2 (in binary 010)

However, the reverse is slightly different.

The decimal number 2 (in binary 10) -> has a complement of 1 (in binary 01)
(i.e. do not pad leading zeros with 1's)

## Converting Roman Numerals to Int

We use a *sorted map*, which is a data structure that we will discuss in class on Monday.
