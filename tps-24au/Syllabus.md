# Syllabus 

Learning outcomes by the end

* Introduce yourself confidently, as if an interview.
* Know where you are  in the roadmap
* Code a prepared problem, of your choice, at a whiteboard
	* explaining your thought process and your steps
	* from start to finish, from scratch
	* you may refer to notes on paper

For full credits in Technical Problem-Solving, over the 10 weeks of the quarter:
* Attend at least 75% of all classes
	* Zoom attendance does not count unless you have an accommodation for the whole quarter.
* Solve at least 15 problems total of your choice from the assigned problems on Leetcode, Hackerrank, and Advent of Code and submit screenshots of your profile progress.
	* The problems must show increasing difficulty (decreasing acceptance rates)

* Complete at least 16 of the weekly problems assigned in homeworks (20 total)
  * With only 1 rejected attempt and 1 accepted attempt.
  * Submit screenshots of your Leetcode, Hackerrank, or Advent of Code profile as requested.
  * Partial credit is granted, 1 credit per 4 weekly problems.
* Livecode in front of the class one of the above problems of your choice
* You may substitute up to half of the problems above (8 problems) for embedded hardware projects
  * Raspberry Pi
  * Arduino
  * other single-board computer brought to class

* Describe your thought process out loud with confidence
  * be able to ask for hints at the right time, with right level of specificity
* Understand pseudocode
* Cultivate a desire for discomfort, solve unseen problems, and risk being unable to do them.

## Final Project Requirements

* 400-500 lines of code in the programming language you've been solving technical problems in, committed to git
* 3 to 4 unit tests
* uses at least 2 data structures and 2 algorithms
  * beyond arrays and linked lists, and beyond what you used in DSA last year
* a dataset with at least 10,000 items
