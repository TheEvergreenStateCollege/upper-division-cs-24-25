Create a README.md in your project directory describing your project and how to demo it, so that one of your classmates can completely duplicate your two operations, on the limited CSV data you can commit into the class monorepo. Follow the template from Devpost Hackathons:
Inspiration

The suffix tree is inspired by the prefix tree, but reversed.

Software Design Diagram (see the next problem)

    ?

How to run our demo on our included data

    Run the suffix tree file.

How to run our tests and what they mean

    Checking if a suffix is contained within a tree for a word

How we built it (your tech stack)

    I imagine that I will build it by typing code into a java file and running it until it works.

Challenges we ran into

    I'm not sure. I imagine it will probably be easy.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

    What I hope that I will be proud of is fully understanding a suffix tree and being able to implement it handily

What we learned

What's next for the project next quarter (as an app engineered for the web)
