# Technical Problem-Solving - Week 08
2024-11-22 Friday

Announcements:
* Suffix Trees
* TPS HW 07 - System Diagram
* Final Project Proposals (time to work on it today)
* Thanksgiving Next Week

## Suffix Trees

Compressed prefix trees:
* a character sequence (and some metacharacters) along each edge from parent to child.
* some subtrees are identical and can be represented as references to the same data structure.

Discussion:
* Is the longest path from root to any non-leaf (interior) node the LRS?
  * justify your reasoning if you think it's true
  * if you think it's false, try to give a counterexample
    * bonus: also try to give a correct statement of how to find LRS

Example of how (DFS on ) Suffix Trees can solve LRS

Code for this has been written in Rust and C++ by Evergreen students last year.

## System Diagrams

Message Queues 
* pub-sub pattern
* messages and topics
* brokers and clients

As a group, we'll come up with a system diagram for the farm data system with at least 10 components.
