# Technical Problem-Solving Class Notes
Week 04 - Friday, 2024-10-25

## First Hour

dynamic programming: keep a table of solved sub-problems.



example:
* longest unrepeating letters substring from two weeks ago (LULS)

abccbad

26-bit vector at each slot (fits in an int in most languages)

|     | First char --> | 0        | 1       | 2      | 3          | 4    | 5          |
| --- | -------------- | -------- | ------- | ------ | ---------- | ---- | ---------- |
|     | Last char      | b        | a       | n      | a          | n    | a          |
| 0   | b              | "b"      | -       | -      | -          | -    | -          |
| 1   | a              | "ba"     | "a"     |        |            |      |            |
| 2   | n              | "ban"    | "an"    | "n"    |            |      |            |
| 3   | a              | "bana"   | "ana"   | "na"   | "a", (1,1) |      |            |
| 4   | n              | "banan"  | "anan"  | "nan"  | "an"       | "n"  |            |
| 5   | a              | "banana" | "anana" | "nana" | "ana"      | "na" | "a", (1,1) |

$O(n^2)$ space 
$O(n^3)$ time

Some ideas to optimize to $O(n^2)$ time.

* Construct a dynamic programming table
	* what are the sub-problems?
	* how do we index them?
* Consider the table above
	* Start with shortest substrings, try to match with longer substrings earlier.

If you have a suffix-tree builder, you can solve LRS in O(n) time.
