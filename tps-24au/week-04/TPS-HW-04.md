## Part I

Optimize your brute-force solution to longest repeated substring (LRS) on Kattis so that it makes progress beyond your last screenshot.

(For example, if it runs out of memory or exceeds the time limit).

Your goal is to make progress and pass more tests than in TPS-HW-03, not necessarily pass all the tests.

You may use any of the techniques we cover in class (dynamic programming).

Timebox yourself to 3 hours of work outside of class.

## Part II

Complete any two problems from past ICPC's, either Division I or Division II.

http://acmicpc-pacnw.org/results.htm

Include which year and division of your choice for each problem, and explain the similarities and differences to any previous LeetCode or Kattis problem we've solved this quarter.
