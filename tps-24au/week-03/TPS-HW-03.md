* This homework is assigned late but was introduced on Monday of Week 03, the longest repeating substring problem.
	* Given a string, return the *longest* substring which contains at least two repetitions of an identical sequence of characters, either immediately following each other in the string, *or with overlaps.* (The overlaps is new since Monday)
	* The answer can be "" the empty string if no such repetitions occur
	* Input: "banana" --> Output: either "na" or "an" 
	* input "aabcabcd" --> Output: "abc"
	* input: "aabcbcbcdbcd" --> Output: "bcd"
