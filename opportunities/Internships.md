# Computer Science Internships

Most internships are for upper division computer science students in the summer after their second or third year,
before they return to college for their fourth year.

However, there are internships for beginning (first year) students, as well as for seniors right are graduation.
Please read the details for each opportunity you are interested in.

Deadlines for Summer 2025 internships are typically in Autumn 2024 (right now). Please be pro-active
in applying or asking for support from CS faculty and staff.

Luis Apolaya Torres is our Assistant Director in the College Internships office to help you with every step of
the process (finding opportunities, resume preparation, interview preparation).
