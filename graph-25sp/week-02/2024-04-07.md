### Scala For Loops

Try the following Scala programs in `Scastie` 

Scala for comprehension, generators, and yield

A generator: a partial function that can be called, paused, and resumed, until it completes.
(For our purposes, this is the functional version of an interator in object-oriented languages, which is an object
that proceeds through a collection in a certain order).


```
def foo(n: Int, v: Int) =
   for i <- 0 until n
       j <- 0 until n if i + j == v
   yield (i, j)

foo(10, 10).foreach {
  (i, j) => println(s"($i, $j) ")  // prints (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 5) (6, 4) (7, 3) (8, 2) (9, 1)
}
```
