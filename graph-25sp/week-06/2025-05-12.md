# Graph Algorithms in Scala

12 May 2025

Continue working on Prim's algorithm for minimum spanning tree in Scala.

Our starter code

https://gist.github.com/learner-long-life/c18687163f4ea057b08bf4521824fb51

In-Class Activity:

* Modify your `Edge` class, so that we store `val least` and `val most`, which are
  * the node letters in sorted order.
  * In the static initializer (the space of variables and initialization that would normally be in the constructor)
    * write something like `val least = first.letter if (first.letter < second.letter) else second.letter`
    * and then followed by `val most = second.letter if (second.letter < first.letter) else first.letter`
* Run and check our MST code together afterwards, see if all the `println` output matches your expectations.

[Here is our code together](https://scastie.scala-lang.org/learner-long-life/EdMZD6BmSy2T5hMF0qUvIw/38)

Email me how far you got at the end, with your new code, and I'll respond.

We'll continue together for the full two hours (on Tuesday).
