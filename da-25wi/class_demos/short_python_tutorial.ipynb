    "2.  vectors and matrices\n",

    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a powerful and popular open-source programming language.  It is particularly effective for *scientific prototyping*, i.e. the process of performing first-pass explorations of a scientific problem through numerics, graphics, and simulations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python syntax is fairly intuitive, though the language has some quirks.  This tutorial is designed to help the complete novice get comfortable with select elements of the language.  The Web is awash with additional tutorials, and the student who wishes to master the language should work through a more detailed tutorial after finishing this one.  Recommended tutorials include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  The Official Python Tutorial:  https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/\n",
    "2.  The Code Academy:  https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python\n",
    "3.  Wikibooks:  https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/A_Beginner's_Python_Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many others great options as well:  a google search is a good place to start.  Ultimately,  one learns to code by coding:  after working through a tutorial, you need to set yourself a project, sit down at a terminal, and try to bring it to completion. It is only by stumbling, and then figuring how to correct things, that you will gain a true mastery of the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "### I.  Basic algebraic operations\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using Python 2 in this tutorial.  There is actually a Python 3 which has lots of improvements over Python 2; the problem is that many applications are built on Python 2, and are not ready for Python 3.  The good news is that much of the higher functionality of Python 3 is available to Python 2 by \"importing\" certain modules.  This is what we do in the following code cell.  To run the cell, click on it, and then click on the arrow button at the top of the page (or hit \"Shift-Enter\".)"
