# Drone Pilot Exam Studying Experience Reports

This is an experience report for an Individual Learning Contract at The Evergreen State College for
the drone pilot exam administered by the FAA.

This is based on a Spring 2025 individual study with Will Wiencken and Paul Pham.

It is written here to aid in future individual learning contracts.

In FAA regulations, drones are officially known as unmanned aircraft (UA) or
small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS). A license is only required for
flying drones weighing 0.55 pounds up to 55 pounds for commercial purposes,
in public airspaces, over populated areas, and other restrictions covered
by Part 107 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).

The exam is officially known as the UA (Unmanned Aircraft) Exam.

In particular, the College has a large multi-spectral drone used in its
GIS (Geospatial Information Systems) and MES (Masters of Environmental Science) programs.

Piloting this drone requires an FAA license that comes from passing this exam.

FAA regulations require you to bring a document typing your name to your current address,
such as a photo ID (driver's license) with your current address, a signed apartment lease,
or utilities bills.

## Recommendations for Future Contracts

Evergreen individual contracts describe a proposal and a commitment between both a learner
and faculty member to formally describe a plan of study during a particular quarter.

Because your learning interests, goals, and circumstances are unique to you,
there is no one exact format that fits all plans and learners. However, at a high level, your
contract should include, in a written document submitted to the College at my.evergreen.edu,
the following elements:

* What you plan to learn
  * This should include a 10 week plan, resources you plan to follow, and a scope of what is or is not included in your study.
* How you plan to learn it
  * This should include any class meeting times with the faculty member, the format of the class meetings, what learning activities and exercises.
* How you and your faculty member will evaluate your success
  At the end of quarter, what will you accomplish or produce and what features will it incorporate?

Additional and optional elements are encouraged to this contract to express your individual learning style and preferences.
