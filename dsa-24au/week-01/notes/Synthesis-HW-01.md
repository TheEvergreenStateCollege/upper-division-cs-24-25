# DSA Synthesis Homework 01

Assigned Thursday, October 3rd, 12noon
Due following Thursday, Oct 10th (5pm)

Do the following readings and submit the requested handwritten work for this Canvas assignment

On each assignment, include your name, date, and any online resources or at most one other classmate that you pair programmed with.

* [The Algorithm Design Manual, 2nd edition online](https://archive.org/details/algorithmdesignm0000skie/page/10/mode/2up?view=theater) (3rd edition is fine as well)
  * 1.1 through 1.3 Reasoning About Correctness (pages 1 through 19)
  * Attempt a solution and write out your thought process by hand for these exercises
    * Problem 1-5, parts (a), (b), (c) counterexamples to various algorithms for knapsack problem
    * Problem 1-8, prove the correctness of Horner's method for evaluating polynomials
      * Hint: to start, you can try to prove that the given pseudocode algorithm for Horner's works for evaluating $$p(x) = x^2 + 3x + 1$$ at $x = 12$
    * Problem 1-12, prove-by-induction the sum of cubes

* [On Pair Programming](https://martinfowler.com/articles/on-pair-programming.html#HowToPair)
  * Read Part One: How to pair
  * (You will get to practice pair programming in Week 02, in both class and the zyBooks homework)

* [The Live Code Manual](https://livecodingbook.toplap.org/book/#)
  * Read Chapter 1 Introduction to Live Coding: A Userâ€™s Manual
  * If you have the paper book, it is pages 1-12.

* Write a few sentences for each prompt, drawing connections between every two of the three readings above (finding similarities and differences)
  * How does the practice of pair programming relate to, or how can you apply it, to zyBooks assignments?
  * How does the practice of livecoding relate to the practice of learning to program from zyBooks or in technical interviews for companies hiring software engineers?
  * How do the practices of pair programming and livecoding relate to each other?

Bonus: if you would like to see what the livecoding community talks about or performances look like, there is an annual conference every year with Youtube recordings.
