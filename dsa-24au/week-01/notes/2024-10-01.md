# Core DSA
## Week 01 - Tuesday Morning

* Pre-quiz (don't worry, we'll take it again at the end of class) [20 minutes]
	* https://canvas.evergreen.edu/courses/6729/assignments/125953?display=full_width
* 
* SandwichShop code in GitHub
* The GetMaxSandwichOrder problem
* What are some invariants (properties that are always true?)
	* Number of patties is non-negative
	* Number of buns is non-negative
* What invariants could be useful to solve the problem of sandwich order maximization?
	* usually can represent some intermediate progress toward final goal
	* e.g. after using up bunType i, 

* Chess board and game representation, checking problem

* Perspectives
  * Fundamental theorem of DSA
	  * moving from input state to output state
	  * never exceeding the space complexity S(n) for an input size
	  * taking T(n) steps for an input size n
	  * while obeying one or more invariants
  * Time-space tradeoff
	  * lookup table, like the 10x10 arithmetic addition table
	  * how big would a lookup table be for GetMaxSandwichOrder ?


Break

* Dataset collection for your final project
	* mockaroo.com with sandwich data
	* Abandoned WalMart spreadsheet
* Fields / columns in a spreadsheet are like fields in a Java object
* Rows / data items are like the Java objects themselves (a collection of them)
* In your project, you'll want to load a CSV of data
	* You'll have a top-level class (an ADT, like SandwichShop)
	* Answer two questions about your data (two ADT operations)
* Software archaeology: last year's monorepo
  * [last year's projects](https://github.com/TheEvergreenStateCollege/upper-division-cs-23-24/tree/main/dsa-23au/java-dsa)

Post-quiz [20 minutes]

Reminder:
* Academic Plan Draft
