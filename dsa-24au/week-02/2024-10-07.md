# Core DSA - Week 02
2024-10-07 - Monday Morning

RAM Model
	* a large byte array, addressed by index offset
	* instead of a byte array, you can fit large sized structs / POJOs in each slot
	* advantages: fast
	* disadvantages: possibly wasted space
	* can implement links on top of arrays

Kinds of Memory
* Stack (only lives as long as a function call, primitive types)
* Heap (lives across function calls, allocated with `new` keyword)
* Constant pool (lives as long as the program: class definitions, String constants, etc.)

Java Memory References:
* no bare pointers, all strongly typed, all valid,
* all reference counted and deallocated according to garbage collection policy

## Break (10:50)

## Second Hour

[20 minutes] [Resume GitPod setup](https://github.com/TheEvergreenStateCollege/upper-division-cs-24-25/blob/main/dsa-24au/SoftwareSetup.md)

In-class Workshop:

Modify the `toString()` method of one of the Java classes so that you print out the sandwich order with spaces between each sandwich.

It currently looks like
