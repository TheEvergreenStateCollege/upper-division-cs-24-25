# Core DSA, Week-02 Workshop
2024-10-07 - Monday

With a partner:

* Discuss how the given Java code for Sandwich and SandwichShop is the same as, similar to, or different from C/C++ (if you know it or learned it in CSF last year) or any other programming language that you know. If Java is your first programming language, compare and contrast it to English. In particular:
	* what are enumerated types? Where are they useful in a program? Give an example of when they occur in real-life, that you could model in a program with `enum`
	* what is the relationship between filenames and the classes in them?
	* How can you tell the difference between fields (data members) and methods (function members) of a class?
	* Name three or four parts of a method signature in Java. For example, in this method:
* Where would you look to change the Java code to add spaces between sandwiches printed in the sandwich array?
