# Core DSA - Week 10
2024-12-09 Friday

# Learning Outcomes

* How to augment nodes as needed (to solve breadth-first-search)
* What are some considerations when choosing to pair program or not?
* How to combine multiple data structures (smaller ADTs) to make a larger ADT (the zyBooks Hash Map lab)

# Announcements
* Tomorrow is DSA Game 10, take notes today because they will be your study sheet for tomorrow
* 9 Questions, and what notes to take for them. You can choose 3 of them, the rest are bonus.
  * write pseudocode for thesaurus problem from last time, you can use any data structure we've learned. Give T(n) and S(n), assume maximum number of synonyms and antonyms is O(log n)
    * insert new term with synonyms and antonyms
    * getSynonyms for a term
    * getAntonyms for a term
  * fill in two missing methods in Java code for BST zyBooks lab solution, (you'll need to write your own pseudocode tonight)
  * fill in two missing methods in Java code for the Death First Search solution, based on pseudocode we write today
  * fill in two missing methods in Java code for the hash maps zyBooks lab solution, based on pseudocode we write today
 
* Turn in your notes as a PDF to Canvas DSA Workshop 10 and print it out at end of class today.

## Breadth-First Search

Pseudocode from last time

How to return the shortest path from source to target?

You're allowed to augment nodes
* like `.visited`
* what other properties might be useful, and what are their types?

Some invariants which could be useful:
* We always encounter nodes at the closest distance to the source
  * there may be loops (we visit an already visited node, but the second time will be on a longer path)
* The first time we encounter the target, it is the shortest path.
  * the current before we reach the target is one closer to the source.
 
Try completing and modifying this Java code to return the path itself,
instead of just true or false.

With a partner:

Add a row for graphs running times in terms of `|V|` and `|E|`
* what is a create operation that you wrote in the exercise above?
* what is a read operation that you wrote in the exercise above?
* which of the CRUD categories is breadth-first-search?

## Software Anthropology

DSA Synthesis HW 09 - Livecoding and Pair Programming

* What are your impressions and reactions?
* What problem is being solved?
* What technologies are used?
* Where are they stuck?
* How is this as a teaching / learning tool?
* Why can't / don't they switch roles?

https://martinfowler.com/articles/on-pair-programming.html

- Viewpoint of software engineering and development as a human activity.
- Not only about code as final product, but human relationships, empathy, and process
- Not many examples of pair programmers actively developing code manually on the internet (why?)
  - there are more examples of solo development on Twitch
  - for example, [the game programmer Jonathan Blow]()
 
## Hash Maps

(sometimes called hash tables, in java world HashMaps are newer and threadsafe)

Associates keys and values
* destination cities to flight numbers (usually on big airport displays this is an OrderedMap)
* names in your phone's contact list to their phone number.

Direct addressing vs. hash function

What about collisions?

### With a partner

Try out this Java code which sizes the internal table to prime number size,
and uses a number theoretically "perfect" hash function.

[Prime hashmap with separate chains](https://github.com/TheEvergreenStateCollege/upper-division-cs-24-25/tree/main/dsa-24au/week-10/code/prime-hash-map/src/main/java/dev/codewithfriends)

Together, we'll write pseudocode for the zyBooks hash map lab (using a course gradebook example)

[zyBooks lab](https://github.com/TheEvergreenStateCollege/upper-division-cs-24-25/tree/main/dsa-24au/week-10/code/zybooks-hash-maps)

## Study Sheets

Make a PDF of your notes taken in this class and print them out tonight for tomorrow.

Good luck! There will be hot chocolate tomorrow.

We'll take a count for cow milk vs. alt / vegan milk.
