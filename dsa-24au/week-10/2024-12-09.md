How to return the shortest path from source to target?

You're allowed to augment nodes
* like `.visited`
* what other properties might be useful, and what are their types?

Some invariants which could be useful:
* We always encounter nodes at the closest distance to the source
  * there may be loops (we visit an already visited node, but the second time will be on a longer path)
* The first time we encounter the target, it is the shortest path.
  * the current before we reach the target is one closer to the source.

* What are your impressions and reactions?
* What problem is being solved?
* What technologies are used?
* Where are they stuck?
* How is this as a teaching / learning tool?
* Why can't / don't they switch roles?

https://martinfowler.com/articles/on-pair-programming.html

- Viewpoint of software engineering and development as a human activity.
- Not only about code as final product, but human relationships, empathy, and process
- Not many examples of pair programmers actively developing code manually on the internet (why?)
  - there are more examples of solo development on Twitch
  - for example, [the game programmer Jonathan Blow]()

 
## Hash Maps

(sometimes called hash tables, in java world Maps are threadsafe)
