[Final Project Requirements from Syllabus  ](../Syllabus.md)

Note: You do not have to implement a separate final project in Java to satisfy the final project requirements. You just have to include them in any existing final project, in whatever language you are writing them in.  
  
Read through these considerations for your final project (the notes are from TPS class, but they apply to Core DSA as well, especially if you are interested in joining the Organic Farm project).

Write a system architecture document with a 10,000 foot view of your final project.

Describe at least 10 components of your system.

Include diagrams to show the relationships between the major components.

Answer the following questions:

- What is your dataset? What does each row represent, and what are the columns / fields for each row?
- How many rows do you expect?
- How will you collect or generate the data?
    - Mock 1,000 fake rows of this data using the fields you described above, using mockaroo.com
    - Examine your data. Does it look realistic for the kinds of real data that you want to use for your final project? Adjust your schema and regenerate.
- What two questions do you want to answer about your dataset?
- What CRUD operations do you need for your dataset in order to answer these questions?
- What user interface will your final project have? You may use any web or command-line technologies that you know or want to learn. Draw a sketch or type out an example command-line interaction.
