## Doubly-Linked List zyBooks Lab

Representation Invariant:
* list head & tail are {null, not null} together.
* list head and tail are dummy nodes

```

class DummyNode extends Node {
    public DummyNode() {
	    super(null);
    }
}

class SortedList {

}

insertOrdered(T value) {
	Node newNode = new Node(value);
	// Traverse from head to tail until we reach one
	// with value greater than value, then insert.
	Node current = this.head;
	while (current != null) {
		if (current.value > value) {
			// current is at the node we insert in front of
			Node prev = current.prev;
			current.prev.next = newNode;
			newNode.prev = current.prev;
			newNode.next = current;
			current.prev = newNode;
			break;
		}
		current = current.next;
	}
}

```

## Undo Stacks zyBooks Lab

* Polymorphism - same behavior on multiple types
	* interfaces
	* generics

(objects of) Sub-types can appear, or be assigned to, (references of) super-types
```
List<String> x = new ArrayList<>();
x.add("abc");
x = new LinkedList<>();
x.add("def");
```

* Liskov substitution principle
	* If S is a sub-type of T, then anywhere T appears, we should be able to substitute S and still have our program "work"
	* Semantic definition, not just syntactic
```
public interface UndoCommand() {
	public void execute();
}

public class R

```
