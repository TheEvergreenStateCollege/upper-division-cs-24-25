class DummyNode extends Node {
    public DummyNode() {
	    super(null);
    }
}

class SortedList {

}

insertOrdered(T value) {
	Node newNode = new Node(value);
	// Traverse from head to tail until we reach one
	// with value greater than value, then insert.
	Node current = this.head;
	while (current != null) {
		if (current.value > value) {
			// current is at the node we insert in front of
			Node prev = current.prev;
			current.prev.next = newNode;
			newNode.prev = current.prev;
			newNode.next = current;
			current.prev = newNode;
			break;

## Git-Tac-Toe Workshop

With a partner, play tic-tac-toe by pulling, editing a text file, committing, and pushing to the class mono-repo following these instructions and submitting the URL of your final git commit.

Since you will take turns "driving", you can discuss your moves. Don't worry about who wins, but for our workshop today, it's better not to reach a draw. Once either X or O wins, use `git checkout <commit>` to rewind your time machine to past moves.
