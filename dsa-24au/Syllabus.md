You can and are encouraged to work in a team, and to add a user interface if you need help to write 300 lines of code.

You can use shared code that is written in a team or pair programming, submitted under your own github account.
List your teammate names.

As a team, write a README.md file answering the following questions:



Try to re-type the code yourself when possible, especially if one of your teammates is willing
to read it to you as a navigator while you are the driver.

You may choose one of the following ways to show understanding of what some of the code does and why it solves your problem:
