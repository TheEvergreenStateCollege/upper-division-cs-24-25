# DSA Week 10 Final Project - Electric Vehicle Population Data (Thurston County)
What dataset do you analyze? Are there multiple tables? For each table, answer what are the rows and what are the columns.
    - My dataset consists of data on electric vehicles that are registered through the Washington State Department of Licensing. Each row represents an electric vehicle that is registered in the county. 
        a. Fields: VIN, County (Registered in), City, State, Postal Code, Model Year, Make, Model, Electric Vehicle Type, Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle Eligibility, Electric Range, Legislative District, DOL Vehicle ID

What questions is your software meant to answer on your dataset?
    -  What is the most common/popular Make that is registered in Thurston County? 
    - Of the most common Make, what is the most common Model? 

What algorithms and data structures did you use?

What is their time and space complexity using big oh notation?

How can someone test your code? For example, what are some example inputs and the corresponding output you expect.

Consider what the command-line interface would be, or API requests and responses if you have a website.
    - If this project were connected to an API, a GET request would be used to pull the data and display to the user for viewing. 

What challenges did you encounter and how did you solve them?

What programming languages, frameworks, or technologies did you use?
    - This program uses only Java. 

Who are your teammates, if any?
    - I did not work with any teammates on this assignment.
