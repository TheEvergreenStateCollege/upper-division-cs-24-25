# Paul Pham Faculty and Community Covenant

This covenant is written and agreed to by Paul Pham, and applies to the following
threads which are part of the
Data Structures and Algorithms program in Autumn 2024 at The Evergreen State College (TESC).

We take the word "Covenant" to mean "a calling together" and a community agreement, which is submitted at TESC as required by all programs and provided to all class

The initials may be used to refer to the program or thread ("DSA", or upper-case Data Structures and Algorithms)
or to the academic study and practice within computer science and engineering around the world ("dsa", or lower-case data structures and algorithms).

* the 4 credit thread of "Core DSA", designed for students who have never taken a college level course in dsa.
* the 4 credit thread of "Technical Problem-Solving", designed for students who have already taken and shown proficiency in a college-level course in Data Structures and Algorithms.
  * this includes students who have taken a previous instance of DSA at Evergreen *and* earned the full 12 credits *and* received a positive evaluation indicating proficiency.

Learner will include students, any registered and auditing, as well as faculty. We will call classroom participants called in this document, Learners.

We ask you, as a Learner, to think of yourself as a scholar and practitioner who endeavors to balance learning how to create and implement dsa yourselves from scratch with applying ready-made dsa's to solve problems.

They combine and agree to seek feedback and evaluation on the following competencies:
* understanding the abstract and mathematical concepts underlying DSA, such as time/space complexities.
	* Understanding is shown by answering questions, drawing pictures of data structures or memory diagrams of an algorithm running, or graphs showing orders-of-growth of time or space.
* implementing dsa in Java given in pseudocode.
	* Understanding is shown by typing by hand code in Java that builds and compiles without errors and passes unit tests.
* 

We differentiate this from an *Algorithm Designer* , one who primarily creates and designs new algorithms, usually in pseudocode, and reasons and thinks about their correctness.


This covenant may be similar to, but does not necessarily apply to,
the other threads of DSA:

* the 4 credit thread of "Sofware Engineering" taught by Jessica Carey.
* the 4 credit thread of "Parallel and Distributed Computing" taught by Richard Weiss.

Learners should consult with the other faculty members for these threads for questions and concerns regarding community agreements in those threads.

## Atmosphere, Mindset, Retryability

The goal of these threads is to provide a safe, welcoming, and
challenging environment to push past your comfort zone, increase
your technical proficiency, and to demonstrate understanding to my academic community?

We endeavor to provide an atmosphere of belonging which is relaxed but focused.

While the skills in these Threads may be useful for passing technical interviews and gaining employment in the tech industry, as Learners we focus instead on these other motivations:

* What part of dsa piques your interest, makes you feel most satisfied, or leaves you feeling energized and desirous of more? If any.
* Can I apply dsa to my personal projects, academic learning plan, and other goals in life?
* How can I dedicate and enjoy my time in this program focusing on dsa concepts that I might never have the opportunity to understand from scratch again?

We ask that you attempt and turn in as much as possible each assignment and quiz by the deadline (usually one week after being released) even if it's incomplete.

After that, you will be allowed unlimited retries and corrections to increase the excellence and proficiency of your submission.

## Values and Skills

These 
As a classroom participant, I endeavor to cultivate the following qualities of a
good teammate .

* **Value 1: integrity**: communicating directly and honestly in a way that will help others, including ways to help others help oneself if the offer is made. Not taking credit for others accomplishments or seeking undue benefit at the expense of others. Being respectful and compassionate about vulnerabilities disclosed by others.
	* Positive Example: "I am feeling overwhelmed by the current level of detail or number of tools to learn. I am asking for 1 more week to complete Homework 5 at my own pace."
* **Value 2: Balance and Sensitivity.** a sense of appropriateness, cultivating all these qualities in a holistic way based on how relative proportions of each are required in the moment, constant adjustment.
* **Value 3: Welcoming contribution.** continuing the conversation, supporting other Algorists, "yes and", building upon the work of others, giving proper credit, discovering when feedback, encouragement, or gentle interest would be welcome by other Learners
* **Value 4: Excellence.** gaining incremental proficiency, seeking continual feedback, a commitment to increasing 
* **Value 5: Energy and Initiative.** connecting with a strong inner desire to improve, making progress even in isolation, not waiting for others to reach out first.

## Learner Behavior 
The Learners and Paul Pham agree to show up to class sessions on-time, sober, properly dressed, and ready to learn.
* Mondays 10am at LIB 2619
* Tuesdays 10am at LIB 2619
## Student Evaluations

Paul will be responsible for sending week 5 credit updates by canvas message for the assignment for students in his "Evaluation Section", what may be called a Seminar in other TESC programs, letting them know if they are behind in any of the threads.

These will include 2/3rds of all students who are registered for DSA by the end of Week 1, roughly 20 students, including all students in the "Technical Problem-Solving" thread. If students in Paul's Evaluation Section do not receive a week 5 update

"Paul Evaluation Section", "Richard Evaluation Section", "Jessica Evaluation Section" will be sections in the Canvas course that students can view.

Learners may switch with someone in the other Evaluation Sections for Jessica Carey and Richard Weiss within the first two weeks of the quarter by asking the appropriate faculty member and a classmate in that section. Afterwards, they must verify that they are in the correct Canvas section.

Paul will submit an accurate evaluation for each student by the end of 

### Core DSA
To receive the full 4 credits for Core DSA, learners agree to spend

### Attendance

Learners agree to attend all
class sessions in-person to the best of their
ability. Acceptable reasons to miss class and to receive a link to the video recording 


Learners who need an accommodation to attend remotely through Zoom for the entire quarter agree to seek a notice from TESC's Accessibility office (TRIO).



### Collaboration and Academic Honesty Policy

Learners are allowed to use the following sources for help and should give credit to these sources by name or URL in their Reflections on canvas each week.

Learners may work with one other human classmate on homeworks.

Learners may use internet search (Google, Bing, Stackoverflow etc.) to find related technical information, and in their Reflections, in addition to the link, should describe how they adapted this information, and if the information was wrong or didn't work.

In these threads, students are asked to
understand and only submit work that is the
result of their own understanding. They certify
that any work submitted to zyBooks, Canvas, or GitHub
under their account is one that they are able to explain,
or one that they are able to ask further questions to improve their ability to answer.

They agree that they may be asked to answer questions 
on this work first in written form, and later in oral form, especially if their work resembles that generated from an AI, either deliberately or accidentally.

Use of artificial intelligence, including hosted AI chats such as
OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, Anthropic's Claude; self-hosted models including is allowed only with reflection. Students who use these models are asked to submit links to the entire transcripts of their chat and primarily to use the AI chat to gain proficiency themselves, and to be able to double-check and correct mistakes. With their homework they should submit 

"hacking approach" getting the job done.
google searching

code should compile and complete the assignment.

Catherine: ask for reflection, if using AI


anything more than small snippets (anything more than 3 lines of code)
cite their source, stackoverflow
