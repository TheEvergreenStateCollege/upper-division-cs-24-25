# Textbooks

There are two required textbooks in this class.

The first is an online interactive textbook with programming labs and exercises from zyBooks,
similar to the one you used for Computer Science Foundations last year.

This is a paid textbook where you will be asked to register the first time you access a reading
or homework assignment from Canvas that goes into zyBooks.

The second will be a source of readings, in-class workshops, and project ideas:

[The Algorithm Design Manual by Steven Skiena](https://archive.org/details/2008-book-the-algorithm-design-manual/page/218/mode/2up)

The second edition is available online for free via the Internet Archive.
