# Core DSA - Week 09

* Learning Goals
  * recognize data structures and algorithms in code you are already writing
  * recognize data structures and algorithms in websites / APIs that you use

* Example: what data structures might be used to render the Facebook page?

* What algorithms might be used to:
  * recommend new friends?

* CRUD operations

* "Periodic Table" of DSA
