# Python Implementation of Reinforcement Learning Equations
The following documents demonstrate working examples of some of the most vital equations from Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (second edition) by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto. The code is written in Python and commented with additional context.

- [Figure 2.3: Temporal Difference Equation](2.3.md)
- [Figure 3.14: Bellman Equation for State Value](3.14.md)
- [Figure 4.10: Value Iteration Equation](4.10.md)
