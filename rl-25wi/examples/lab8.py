"""A module implementing lab 8 (Dyna-Q maze).

Taken from example 8.1 (Sutton & Barto p164).

I wrote this by carefully reading the pseudocode for tabular Dyna-Q and 
implementing each mathematical object it mentions, independent of the 
overall algorithm.

As a result, it should be relatively easy to extend this to Dyna-Q+, as 
all the constituent parts are reusable - the only things that remain
are to record recency and add an additional term to the reward signal 
in the q-value updates.

But also the types, constants and functions I needed are all 
interleaved, and not ordered in a way that would be practical for a 
real application with a long-term development lifecycle. So don't use 
this as a model for tidiness.

It runs alright but I'm not convinced it's correct.

"""The choice of which variables to capture was kind of arbitrary. I 
could capture them all rather than any parameter passing, or do all 
parameter passing.

It's good to favor passing parameters. Closures are very magical and 
not easy on the reader.

Here I thought five parameters was too much for alphaterm, so I decided 
to capture the two that were nested deepest/used the most. If I wanted 
to be really slick, I could wrap the whole q update in a single lambda 
and reuse it between (d) and (f.4).
